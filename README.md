istockExtraUserStats - Extra stats for contributors to iStockphoto
==================================================================

This is a Chrome extension. It adds an extra tab (with the title _Extra Stats_) to a contributors profile page. Selecting that tab pulls the CSV stats file for the chosen year (or the current year if no year is chosen) and graphs all the non-zero data sets contained therein.
